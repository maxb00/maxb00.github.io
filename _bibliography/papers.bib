In short, this is unsustainable. Several publishers and a few notable companies have provided meritable solutions, although most are plagued with problems including minimal problem sets, limited customization options, high cost, and even a disconnect with the pedagogical needs within academia. This paper presents a survey of the more popular solutions currently available, followed by a presentation of our newly-developed web application, MOCSIDE: open-source and scalable online IDE and auto-grader for computer science education.},

In short, this is unsustainable. Several publishers and a few notable companies have provided meritable auto-grading solutions, although most are plagued with problems including minimal problem sets, limited customization options, high cost, and at times even a disconnect with the pedagogical needs of academia. This poster presents our newly-developed web application, MOCSIDE, an open-source and scalable online IDE and auto-grader for computer science education. Results indicate a positive user experience from students and instructors alike, with cost savings, ease of use, and code collaboration highlighted as key features.},
